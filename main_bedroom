*Main Bedroom

 You are awakened by the dull light of a candle and the smell of iron in the air. You feel something soft on your skin and look down to see you are wrapped in velvet sheets stained with a familiar red liquid.

 It's blood. Blood that seems like it has permanently stained into the velvet sheets.

 You try to remember where you are, but all you come across are painful headaches that leave you powerless. In the far corner you hear an old telephone ring. You cautiously turn to see a golden handled turn dial phone in the far left side of the room. In front of you is a door, bloodstains leading towards it as if someone had crawled from outside to the bed.

   #Answer the phone 
   You walk over to the rotary phone as it continues to ring, breaking the eerie silence of the room. You stop in front of the phone in a moment of hesitation. You take a deep breath before you pick up the receiver and put it up to your ear, “Hello, this is you wake up call.” Says a haunting females voice in monotone, “Please join us in the main theatre down the hall from your room for tonight’s festivities.” Afterwards the strange voice quickly hung up. You turn to the door, looking down at the bloodstains on the floor, thinking to yourself how you could have possibly ended up here. One thing was for certain. You needed to get out. You walk out the blood stained door to find a candle sitting on a small plate on top nightstand with a note saying “Take me”. You pick up the candle in the completely dark hallway and do the only thing you can; start walking.

   #Walk out of the door 
   You slowly get out of the bed, the phone still ringing in the dead silent room.  You look down at the bloodstains on the floor, the handprints and drag marks becoming more evident as you walk over them. You feel your heart racing as the phone continues to ring in the corner, a sound that crawls up your spine and sends shivers through every muscle. Just as you reach for the doorknob, the phone suddenly stops ringing. You take a deep breath and let out a sigh of relief. That’s when you hear a knock at the door. The sound nearly gives you a heart attack. You pause for a moment, hoping whatever is on the other side will simply go away. Then another knock. You feel your muscles stiffen as the door hand shakes and the door slowly opens. On the other side of the door, in an ominous dark hallway was a nightstand with a single candle a note labeled “Take me.” The candle is the only source of light in the empty hall and against your better judgement you grab the small plate the candle was sitting on and begin your journey into the abyss.

*First Hallway 

You head out towards the darkness of the hall, the silence and shadows slowly surrounding you. As soon as you step out of the door, it quickly slams behind you almost knocking you over. You look out towards the inky blackness and see what appears to be a never ending hallway. You take a deep breath before you begin to slowly trot into the seemingly infinite abyss. As you walk you look on either side of you, seeing tall walls with intricate wooden carvings stained with blood and hand prints. You see on your left side the words ‘Help me’ written in blood before the trail travels down the wall and down the center of the hall, as if the person that wrote it was pulled from the wall and dragged across the floor. As you walk, you come across two doors in front of you. The door to the left has the word ‘up’ engraved in the plaque above it and the door to the right had the word ‘climb’ engraved above it
